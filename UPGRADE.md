# Upgrade Guide

## From v2 to v3


### Bug Fixes
* 429s errors are now handled correctly (instead of a meta error)
* $stream->stream and $stream->response now return the stream and response
* Reduced buffer size to the minimum **drastically increase the "time to first tweet"**, from around 30 seconds to never for small streams to the first moment the tweet is posted.
 
### Major

* Instead of a list of fields, `TwitterStream->fields()` now takes an array 
  For the field `tweet_fields.author_id`: the previous version was `->fields('tweet.author_id')`, the new version is `->fields(['tweet' => ['author_id']) 
* The callable in the `listen()` method is no longer bound to the stream.
  ```php
  $stream->listen($connection, function (object $tweet, \Felix\TwitterStream\TwitterStream $stream) {
    $stream->stopListening();
    // instead of
    $this->stopListening(); # does not work anymore  
  })
  ```
* The `RuleManager` returns a `TwitterResponse`, that implements the PSR `ResponseInterface`, not the PSR `ResponseInterface` directly
* `RWC\TwitterStream\Connection` has been renamed to `RWC\TwitterStream\TwitterConnection`
*
